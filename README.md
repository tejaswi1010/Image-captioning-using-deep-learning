Image Captioning Using Deep Learning
This project aims to generate captions for images using deep learning techniques. We use a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, for generating human-like captions. The goal is to train a model that can analyze images and generate descriptive text, like a human would.
