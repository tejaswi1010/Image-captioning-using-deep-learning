Image Captioning Using Deep Learning        
This project aims to generate captions for images using deep learning techniques. We use a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, for generating human-like captions. The goal is to train a model that can analyze images and generate descriptive text, like a human would.

Overview  
The image captioning model uses a two-part architecture:  

Encoder: A CNN-based model (e.g., ResNet or InceptionV3) that extracts features from images.  
Decoder: An LSTM-based model that generates captions based on the extracted features.  
The model is trained using a dataset like MS COCO or Flickr8k/Flickr30k and aims to generate a natural language description for a given image.
